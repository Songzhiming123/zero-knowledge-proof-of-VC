# Zero-knowledge-proof-VC
## Note
This repository contains some corresponding smart contracts and programs of zero-knowledge proof of ZoKrates, and they can be used for the proposed digital identity verification and management system of verification certificate of blockchain.  

***●***  The document, age verifiable certificate, contains four smart contracts:      
           (1) Cert_Status_SC.sol:  The smart contract of status managment of verifiable certificates.      
           (2) Cert_IsUsed_SC.sol:  The smart contract of status managment of zk_proof.    
           (3) Cert_ZK_Proof.sol:   The smart contract of verifying whether zk_proof is valid.    
           (4) VerifySignature.sol: The smart contract of verifying whether the digital signature of IDP is valid.    

***●***  The document, income verifiable certificat, contains four smart contracts:      
           (1) Cert_Status_SC.sol:  The smart contract of status managment of verifiable certificates.      
           (2) Cert_IsUsed_SC.sol:  The smart contract of status managment of zk_proof.    
           (3) Cert_ZK_Proof.sol:   The smart contract of verifying whether zk_proof is valid.    
           (4) VerifySignature.sol: The smart contract of verifying whether the digital signature of IDP is valid.   

***●***  The document, age Zokrates, contains some files related with zero knowlwdge proof:     
           (1) age_Cert.zok: The verification program of constrain conditions of zero-knowledge proof.  
           (2) ZK_Proof_SC.sol: The original smart contract generated by age_Cert.zok.     

***●***  The document, income Zokrates, contains some files related with zero knowlwdge proof:     
           (1) income_Cert.zok: The verification program of constrain conditions of zero-knowledge proof.  
           (2) ZK_Proof_SC.sol: The original smart contract generated by income_Cert.zok.
